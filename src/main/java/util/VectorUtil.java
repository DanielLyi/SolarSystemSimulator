           Equation for a sphere is ||x_vec - c_vec||^2 = r^2,
           where c_vec is center point,
           r is radius, and
           x_vec describes points on the sphere

           Equation for a line is x_vec = o_vec + d l_vec,
           where d is distance along line from starting point,
           l_vec is direction of the line (unit vector),
           o_vec is origin of the line, and
           x_vec describes points on the line

           Solve equation ||o_vec + d l_vec - c_vec||^2 = r^2

           This equation is equivalent to
           a d^2 + b d + c, where
           a = l_vec . l_vec = ||l_vec||^2
           b = 2(l_vec . (o_vec - c_vec))
           c = (o_vec - c_vec) . (o_vec - c_vec) - r^2 = ||o_vec - c_vec||^2 - r^2

           Solution:
           d = -(l_vec . (o_vec - c_vec)) +/- sqrt(D),
           where discriminant D = (l_vec . (o_vec - c_vec))^2 - (||o_vec - c_vec||^2 - r^2)
           if D < 0, no solution exists
           if D = 0, exactly one solution exists
           if D > 0, two solutions exist
